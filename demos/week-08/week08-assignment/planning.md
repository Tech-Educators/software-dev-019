## Plan your wireframe --> Ok so, Excalidraw

What does my app look like from the user's perspective?

## Plan your database schema --> DrawSQL OR Figma UML diagrams

## What data do I need to store?

Based on the data, how many tables do I need to organise my data efficiently?
If you have two or more tables, what's the relationship between them?
How do I connect the tables? Do I need foreign keys? Do I need junction tables?
Set up your tables in a database in Supabase

## Create a project (database), if you don't have one already

Use the SQL editor to create your tables and insert seed data (add them to a seed file for us to see them when we mark)
You can also use the seed.js file to create and seed your tables

## Upload to GitHub and deploy to Vercel

//we need two packages to connect our database to our server
//pg --> we will use this to build a connection string pool and to send SQL queries to our database
//dotenv --> we will use this to store secrets in our server
//secrets --> sensitive data, passwords, encrypted data
//there are two secrets we want to store in our server:  the database password, and the database connection string

//import dotenv
import dotenv from "dotenv";
//configure the dotenv package to initialise our .env file
dotenv.config();

//import pg
import pg from "pg";

//we are going to create a pool using the connection string
//the pool is our database's waiting area â€“ requests sent to the database will wait in the pool to be processed
